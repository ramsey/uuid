        <!-- At time of writing Psalm reports 65 errors in src, but these are suppressed by being listed in the errorBaseline file
             referenced above. Any new errors will cause a build failure. It might be a good project for someone to go through the errorBaseline
             and delete as many issues as possible, updating the code as they go to top producing the errors. 

             To see the errors in Psalm output, run psalm with the `<double-hyphen> ignore-baseline` option (literal double-hypen is not permitted in XML comment)
