=================
Version 8: Custom
=================

.. note::

    Version 8, custom UUIDs are a new format of UUID, proposed in an
    `Internet-Draft under review`_ at the IETF. While the draft is still going
    through the IETF process, the version 8 format is not expected to change
    in any way that breaks compatibility.

Version 8 UUIDs allow applications to create custom UUIDs in an RFC-compatible
way. The only requirement is the version and variant bits must be set according
to the UUID specification. The bytes provided may contain any value according to
your application's needs. Be aware, however, that other applications may not
understand the semantics of the value.

.. warning::

    The bytes should be a 16-byte octet string, an open blob of data that you
    may fill with 128 bits of information. However, bits 48 through 51 will be
    replaced with the UUID version field, and bits 64 and 65 will be replaced
    with the UUID variant. You must not rely on these bits for your application
    needs.

.. code-block:: php
    :caption: Generate a version 8, custom UUID
    :name: rfc4122.version8.example

    use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;

    $uuid = Uuid::uuid8("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xaa\xbb\xcc\xdd\xee\xff");

    printf(
        "UUID: %s\nVersion: %d\n",
        $uuid->toString(),
        $uuid->getFields()->getVersion()
    );

This will generate a version 8 UUID and print out its string representation.
It will look something like this:

.. code-block:: text

    UUID: 00112233-4455-8677-8899-aabbccddeeff
    Version: 8
