=========================
Version 6: Reordered Time
=========================

.. attention::

    This documentation has moved to :ref:`RFC 4122 UUIDs: Version 6: Reordered
    Time <rfc4122.version6>`.

    Version 6 UUIDs have been promoted to the ``Rfc4122`` namespace. While still
    in draft form, the version 6 format is not expected to change in any way
    that breaks compatibility.

    The :php:class:`Ramsey\\Uuid\\Nonstandard\\UuidV6` class is deprecated in
    favor of :php:class:`Ramsey\\Uuid\\Rfc4122\\UuidV6`.
