==========================

.. rubric:: Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription

Tidelift is working with the maintainers of ramsey/uuid and thousands of other
open source projects to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open
source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk,
and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies
you use.

.. rubric:: Enterprise-ready open source software --- managed for you

The Tidelift Subscription is a managed open source subscription for application
dependencies covering millions of open source projects across JavaScript,
Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, and more.

Your subscription includes:

Security updates
    Tidelift’s security response team coordinates patches for new breaking
    security vulnerabilities and alerts immediately through a private channel,
    so your software supply chain is always secure.

Licensing verification and indemnification
    Tidelift verifies license information to enable easy policy enforcement and
    adds intellectual property indemnification to cover creators and users in
    case something goes wrong. You always have a 100% up-to-date bill of
    materials for your dependencies to share with your legal team, customers,
    or partners.

Maintenance and code improvement
    Tidelift ensures the software you rely on keeps working as long as you need
    it to work. Your managed dependencies are actively maintained and we recruit
    additional maintainers where required.

Package selection and version guidance
    We help you choose the best open source packages from the start—and then
    guide you through updates to stay on the best releases as new issues arise.

Roadmap input
    Take a seat at the table with the creators behind the software you use.
    Tidelift’s participating maintainers earn more income as their software is
    used by more subscribers, so they’re interested in knowing what you need.

Tooling and cloud integration
    Tidelift works with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more. We support every
    cloud platform (and other deployment targets, too).

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade
software, for the full breadth of open source you use. That means less time
grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own
applications—and your business.
